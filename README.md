We are team YooFi for the 2020 Fall CS492 Human-AI Interaction@KAIST by prof. Juho Kim

### Background & Problem

**Background**
- Due to COVID19, more time spent at home, GYM was closed, and meetings were banned.
- There is an increasing interest in home training that can be done at home alone without having to face-to-face with people.
- Among them, yoga is loved as a home training exercise because anyone can do it without any special equipment as long as there is a space on a mat. .

**Previous Works** 
- Since phisical&psychological well-being was originally important in human life, many studies related to health care have already been conducted in the HCI field.
- Existing studies have focused on increasing the estimation accuracy of models based on sensor data or computer vision technology using deep learning technology.
- Sophisticated models and special devices (sensors, kinethic-depth cameras) used for high accuracy are difficult to apply in real life because large computing resources require special devices as resources.

**Problem** 

- However, actual users have a limited amount of money they can use. In order to provide sufficient satisfaction with limited equipment and incomplete accuracy, human AI interaction must be considered, but few studies have been conducted on this. .

### Aim & method

- An aim of our system, which we used pose estimation API based on Computer Vision, is to engage the satisfaction of the user by  focusing on the human-AI interaction that allows the users to experience the bi-directional interaction rather than one-directional lecture from the system.
- Ultimately, it breaks awy from the existing one-directional interaction and enabels bi-directional interaction. 

- Through this advanced form of interaction, futheromre, it is possible for the users to take interactive lessons closer to taking lessons from an actual instructor offline in the space they want by themselves.

### Methodologies

We designed a system which serve 3 main functions

    (1) Visual feedback using skeleton from pose estimation

    (2) Model usage feedback
- In real world, user sometimes did not know what and how to feed the model for an input so we give adequate guidelines when they made unadequate input that the user can chagne their usage pattern.

    (3) Parameter Modification
- The users are be served the setting functions, including times and secs for the training, that help the users can modify the model fit to their circumstances. 
- Even if the accuarcay is low, the user can feel comfortable by changing the setting of sensitivity to flexible. 

###  Results and Implecation
