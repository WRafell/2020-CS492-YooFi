We are team YooFi for the 2020 Fall CS492 Human-AI Interaction@KAIST by prof. Juho Kim

- Due to the pendamic, Yoga get loved as a home training exercise because anyone can do it without any special equipment as long as there is a space for a mat.
- Existing related studies have focused on increasing the estimation accuracy of models based on sensor data or computer vision technology using deep learning technology.
- Sophisticated models or special devices, which were used for high accuracy, are difficult to apply in real life because large computing resources require special devices as resources.
- However, actual users have a limited amount of budget. In order to provide sufficient satisfaction with limited equipment and incomplete accuracy, human AI interaction must be considered.
- An aim of our system, which we used pose estimation API based on Computer Vision, is to engage the satisfaction of the user by focusing on the human-AI interaction that allows the users to experience the bi-directional interaction rather than one-directional lecture from the system.

### Methodologies

We designed a system which serve 3 main functions


(1) Visual feedback using skeleton from pose estimation


(2) Model usage feedback
- In real world, user sometimes did not know what and how to feed the model for an input so we give adequate guidelines when they made unadequate input that the user can chagne their usage pattern.


(3) Parameter Modification
- The users are be served the setting functions, including times and secs for the training, that help the users can modify the model fit to their circumstances. 
- Even if the accuarcay is low, the user can feel comfortable by changing the setting of sensitivity to flexible.
