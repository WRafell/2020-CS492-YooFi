- Due to the pendamic, Yoga get loved as a home training exercise because anyone can do it without any special equipment as long as there is a space for a mat.
- Existing related studies have focused on increasing the estimation accuracy of models based on sensor data or computer vision technology using deep learning technology.
- Sophisticated models or special devices, which were used for high accuracy, are difficult to apply in real life because large computing resources require special devices as resources.
- However, actual users have a limited amount of budget. In order to provide sufficient satisfaction with limited equipment and incomplete accuracy, human AI interaction must be considered.
- An aim of our system, which we used pose estimation API based on Computer Vision, is to engage the satisfaction of the user by focusing on the human-AI interaction that allows the users to experience the bi-directional interaction rather than one-directional lecture from the system.

The system contains three main functions: (1) matching the user's pose with the reference image, (2) giving the hints to the user to correct the pose, and (3) modifying the level of difficulty of the matching algorithm.
